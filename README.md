## 📖 Project Overview
The **Empowering the Nation App** is a cross-platform application built with **React Native (Expo)**.  
It runs on **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web** using one shared codebase.

This system was developed to assist a training institution in managing course registrations efficiently and reducing manual errors.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The business owner previously relied on manual, paper-based registration forms, which often led to:
- Lost or incomplete applications  
- Incorrect fee calculations  
- Time delays in processing student registrations  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The **Empowering the Nation App** allows users to:
- Browse all available short and six-month courses  
- Calculate registration fees automatically  
- Register digitally through the app  
- Receive a **confirmation alert** after successful submission  

The system provides a fast, paperless, and user-friendly experience for both mobile and web users.
